# TODO

## Follow-ups

- [ ] Real app icons (macOS .icns / Assets.car, iOS app icon set)
- [ ] Signing/notarization for the macOS app — already env-gated in
      `apps/desktop/forge.config.cjs` (`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`, `APPLE_ID`,
      `APPLE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`); needs Apple credentials
- [ ] EAS build / TestFlight distribution for the iOS app
- [ ] Native iOS date/time pickers in the event editor
      (`@react-native-community/datetimepicker` — replaces the text inputs;
      requires a prebuild)
- [x] Drag-to-move / drag-to-resize events — done: pointer-event drag on
      desktop (move across days + resize, 15-min snap, Escape cancels,
      click-through preserved), long-press pan + resize handle on iOS via
      gesture-handler/reanimated; shared snap math in core/time/dragMath.ts.
      Out of v1 scope: all-day chips, month view, recurring events
- [x] Recurring-event editing — done: `updateRecurring`/`deleteRecurring`
      rpcs with scope `instance` (exception rows under Google's canonical
      `master_basetime` instance id, cancelled tombstones for deletes),
      `series` (delta-shifted master patch), and `following` (RRULE UNTIL
      truncation + new master with recomputed COUNT; later overrides
      cancelled). Scope picker in both editors; dragging a recurring
      instance commits a single-instance override.

## Deferred architecture upgrades

Both were deliberately deferred during the initial build and have clean
upgrade paths:

- [x] Migrate UI state/data flow to `@effect/atom-react` — done: atoms
      subscribe to fine-grained Reactivity keys (`accounts`/`calendars`/
      `events`); backend invalidations flow through a forwarding bridge
- [x] Replace the hand-rolled Schema-typed IPC bridge with
      `effect/unstable/rpc` — done: `AppBackendRpcs` RpcGroup in core,
      custom duplex protocols over the Electron IPC frame channel
      (`packages/sync/src/rpcDuplex.ts`; a MessagePort transport is a
      drop-in duplex swap), and the invalidation stream is a typed
      `stream: true` rpc
